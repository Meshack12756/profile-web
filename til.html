    <p>
        Just to keep things clear, I cherish laughter; but I also adore the depth in every jest. This should send a signal to you guys that 
        that when I keep myself at seriousness, I make or break things around me. Not even my bestie would want to see my 1% darkside...because it's terrifying!! This are what I hate and abhor:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul29">
        <li>Scolding my reputation</li>
        <li>Dark humor</li>
        <li>Rumbles and Cacophony</li>
        <li>Disrespect</li>
        <li>Taking my kindness for granted</li>
        <li>Unneccesary disturbance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I wish I could continue with this. The list is long and endless. Just don't cross my line though! I love peace and tranquility.
        This is the basis of inner harmony.
    </p>
    <p>Until next time, Adios!!</p>
