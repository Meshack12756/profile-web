    As I said in the home page, my name is Charity Awuor, aka, Gabby. I am 18 years old...currently in campus. You'll find out where later as you 
    navigate through the tabs. 
 </p>
<p>
    I am 1.5 metres tall, dark-skin Cho-co-la-te and of course, <strong>beautiful</strong>. I dedicate every sunrise to the Almighty Deity for my life and the lives of my loved
    ones. I love God...and church is one of the right places  to acknwoledge that.
</p>
<p>
    Due to issues I cannot reveal, I will not tag, at any given moment, my area of residence, albeit I once stayed in the humbles of Kibra.
</p>
<p>
    That's all for now. Jump over to my journey of learning and Education.
