    <h2 class="header29">Learning & Education</h2>
    <p>My learning is always on and off school work. Having started my learning journey in Olympic Primary School...I got a
        eagle vision of how I would want my education would be.
        High school was tough!! Can't reveal it here though...just kidding.
        Currently I'm in Chuka University and the comrade life is not a walk in the park.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some of the institution I walked through:</p>
    <ul class="ul29">
        <li>Primary School: Olympic Primary</li>
        <li>High School: Kisumu Girls</li>
        <li>University: Chuka</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember when I said learning is sometimes off the books...you better believe it! Getting <strong> lashes </strong>from parents, stories from friends and 
        and other content discoveries are all part of learning too! Some are great while others are not negotiable to explanation.
