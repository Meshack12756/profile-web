    <p>I'm in the course of developing my career in various means:</p>
    <ul class="ul29">
        <li>Developing my content creation skills</li>
        <li>Taking my campus education serious</li>
        <li>Building network of connection with people from various walks of life</li>
        <li>Expand a peculiarity of learning something new</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Formulating my career comes with a lot of hardwork, persistence and discipline. Ofcourse, things are not easy but 
        with God as the foundation, nothing can stumble me to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of 2024, I can't really disclose whether I'm in a relationship or not...that's for you to unravel. However, what I can tell you is I have good friends 
        who support, inspire and encourage me all through this comrade life.
    </p>
    <p>
        My family has played a pivotal role in shaping me. Their support has made me who I am today and I can't thank them enough. Here is a short piece to express my
        gratitude towards them:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Querida familia,

Quiero expresar mi más sincero agradecimiento por todo su amor y apoyo. Su presencia en mi vida es un regalo invaluable. Gracias por siempre estar allí para mí.
Los quiero mucho."
